# Embedding-Learning-for-Heterogeneous-Cloud-Service-Graphs
This project uses advanced Graph Neural Networks (R-GCN and HGT) to transform heterogeneous cloud service graphs into low-dimensional embeddings for classification and clustering. It also employs graphon-based data augmentation to overcome data scarcity, enhancing model robustness and facilitating effective service discovery.
